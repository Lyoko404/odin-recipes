    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Rendang is a side dish originating from Minangkabau, Indonesia, made from
      meat that is cooked at a low temperature for a long time using various
      spices and coconut milk.

    <p>
      This dish is one of my favorite because the taste is so delicious and I
      only eat this on special day, like eid fitri.
